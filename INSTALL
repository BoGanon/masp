MASP Assembly Preprocessor Installation Instructions
====================================================

The installation procedure is as follows:

./configure
make
make install

This will install 'masp' under /usr/local by default, to install MASP
in another directory, you can pass the --prefix parameter to the
configure script.  For example, to install 'masp' under /usr, type:

./configure --prefix=/usr

This will install the 'masp' executable in /usr/bin.

For a complete list of parameters you can pass to configure, type:

./configure --help

Uninstall
=========

There is a 'make uninstall' (I think, never tryed it), but the only
thing that gets installed is the masp executable; by default in
/usr/local/bin.

As of yet, there is no documentation or config files.
